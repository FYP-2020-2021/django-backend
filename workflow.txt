## FILE UPLOAD

For React: 
1. Upload document with redux saga
2. Call file upload endpoint with backend proxy and POST to upload
3. Wait for results
4. Handle the received results accordingly

For Django:
1. Create file upload endpoint
2. Take in a file and read in the filename
3. Pass filename into classifier
4. Call to preprocess the document with the corresponding labels
5. Return the results 

Tests: 
1. Ensure file is readable when endpoint is called
	- from endpoint perspective
	- from classification model perspective

To-dos:
1. Create model for classification results
